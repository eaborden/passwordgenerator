# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Project Overview
---
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

###### Purpose of a Password Generator 
```
More and more sensitive data is one company servers.  Having a random password generator allows companies to require stronger passwords to protect their data.  Creating a strong password for users lessens the chance an employee will use their address or their pet's name.

---

###### Generator Functionality
---
The generator has series of prompts to allow the users to do the following
1. Allow user to select a password between 8 and 128 characters long
2. The user is prompted to select if the password will comtain the following characters:
    a. lowercase letters
    b. uppercase letters
    c. numbers
    d. special characters
3. Taking these inputs, the generator creates a string of random variables composed of the selected characters,and the length.  

```

###### Project Accomplishments
---
I was able to accompish a majority of the requirements.  The user is prompted for length and confirms the addition of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.  If the user fails to confirm the inclusion of a variable the generator resets.  I was successful in consoling out a random password with the required length and random characters.

###### Issues - To be fixed
---
I was unable to get the application to pass the password to the form on the addEventListner.  I also could not get an alert prompt to work.  These need to be resolved in the next iteration.
